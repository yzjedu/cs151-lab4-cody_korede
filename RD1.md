The main thing that we were supposed to learn was working with nested conditionals and properly
writing out different routes inside of those conditionals. It also gave use practice working on
while loops. It also allowed us to work on an algorithm that had to be long to accommodate the
various routes the program had to take. Both Cody and I sort of trial-and-errored our way through
both the code and the algorithm because there was a lot unpacked on us at the beginning, but also
not so much that it was unmanageable, that we decided to just keep going through the steps. After
that, then we were able to go back and see what we were missing and what we had to improve. I think
the program came out pretty much just how I wanted it to. I think I would decrease the amount of
comments I made cause even though they are thorough, they can come off as making the code seem cluttered
but the code itself came out just fine and the program works really well. This program was honestly
pretty pain free to make. Although there was a lot to work on and a lot to code, Cody's algorithm was
really thorough and specific that it made it east for us to follow. The tests were all very simple as well
and because of that, the program came out exactly as planned.
