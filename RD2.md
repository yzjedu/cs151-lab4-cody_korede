We were supposed to learn how
to write a program that gave users a choice between package
plans, asking them how much data they used
and then providing them
with their total cost. We first
wrote an algorithm and test
cases so that when we wrote the
program we would have an easy
task in testing. This helped with
nested if statements and using 
the while command. Our results
matched what we expected. We
tried various and extreme
test cases to make sure our program worked 
properly. We first thought and designed
the algorithm, then we tested to program,
then we tested and fixed any issues. 
I think we did learn what we were supposed 
to in this lab. Working with Korde was nice
he did the program and test cases and I did the 
algorithm.
